# Sybil Detection in Token Airdrops

This repository contains the code and data for the research project on Sybil detection in token airdrops using clustering algorithms.

## Overview

The project compares the performance of three clustering algorithms (DBSCAN, HDBSCAN, and OPTICS) for detecting Sybil attacks in the context of blockchain token airdrops. It includes data preprocessing, community detection, clustering analysis, and performance evaluation.


## Requirements

- Python 3.8+
- Required libraries: pandas, numpy, scikit-learn, hdbscan, networkx, community, matplotlib, seaborn, glob
